User Stories for Sprint 1:

As a developer, I want to set up the development environment with Solidity, Remix, Ethereum, and Ganache, so that I can start developing the smart contract.
As a developer, I want to create the basic smart contract structure and data structures (e.g., structs for Patient, Doctor, and Medicine), so that I can implement the user registration functions for both patients and doctors.
As a patient, I want to be able to register my account on the platform, so that I can access my medical records.
As a doctor, I want to be able to register my account on the platform, so that I can access my patients' medical records.
As a developer, I want to implement the access control mechanisms (e.g., onlyDoctor and onlyPatient modifiers), so that only authorized users can access the system.
As a tester, I want to ensure that the user registration functionality and access control are working as expected, so that we can move on to the next sprint.


Sprint 1: Basic Setup and User Registration
Objective: Set up the development environment, create the smart contract structure, and implement user registration functions for both patients and doctors.

Tasks:

Set up the development environment with Solidity, Remix, Ethereum, and Ganache.
Create the basic smart contract structure and data structures (e.g., structs for Patient, Doctor, and Medicine).
Implement the user registration functions for both patients and doctors (registerPatient and registerDoctor).
Implement the access control mechanisms (e.g., onlyDoctor and onlyPatient modifiers).
Test user registration functionality and access control.
Deliverable: A functional smart contract with user registration for patients and doctors.
